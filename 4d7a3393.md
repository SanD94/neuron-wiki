# Thesis Introduction Notes

Tool use literature, little information

Cardinali 2009 -> bodily perception was found to be changed via tool use.

Sposito 2012 -> extension of our bodies.

change in perceiving environment ->  Berti (2000), Farne(2005), Witt(2005), Canzoneri(2013)


VR allows us to manipulate both object properties and agent characteristics while studying the interaction between agents and their environments. An environment could potentially be designed in infinitely many ways. In a VR setting, the experimenter has precise control over the manipulation of the responses of an object to physical forces, as well as the object’s shape, color, size, texture, location, or movement. Since the VR headset completely blocks the visual image coming from the physical world in VR experiment, potential confounding factors such as lighting, context, distances in proportion to the subject’s body, and the angle where the participant sees the object can also be carefully controlled. Moreover, the form and capabilities of an agent can be manipulated via an avatar, which is a virtual representation of the body and its movements in a virtual environment. Avatars provide a sense of presence and agency in virtual environments, where the agent can interact with objects by using, for instance, virtual hands or controllers. 

Why we are doing these studies...

Cisek (1999) criticized the field of psychology by claiming that psychologists study human as a segregated organism from its environment and address different segments of the behavior (i.e., perception, action, and cognition) in isolation. Cognitive science studies provide a rather multidisciplinary perspective to the areas of research that are tackled by different fields of studies independently. The purpose of this study is to examine interactive behavior by using the methods of experimental psychology. The potential implications of the results for the VR applications are also discussed. First, I will provide a scientific background for the flexibility of our perception of the body and its capabilities and how that flexibility affects the way we perceive our environment within the context of affordances. I will then present a reliable way of measuring affordances and using VR for this purpose as a research tool.
